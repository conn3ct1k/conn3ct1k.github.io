        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p>My name is Kanat, and I am a Full Stack Developer,
        <br> 
        Sound Producer, DJ, and Drummer. With a diverse set of skills and passions, 
        <br>
        I enjoy creating unique experiences through music and technology.</p>
    <p>As a Full Stack Developer, I am dedicated to building robust and efficient applications that can make a difference.
        <br> 
        With a keen eye for design and a love for coding, 
        <br>    
        I strive to create user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces that make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>
    <p>As a Sound Producer, DJ, and Drummer, I am passionate about exploring the limitless possibilities of electronic music. 
        <br>
        Whether it's creating experimental beats or mixing up Drum and Bass tracks, 
        <br>
        I am always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of sound and take my audience on a journey.</p>     
    <p>When it comes to music, I have a soft spot for alternative rock, particularly bands like Limp Bizkit, 
        <br>
        Linkin Park, Slipknot, Deftones, Korn, Blink 182. I enjoy playing the drums and electric guitar,
        <br>
        and I believe that music is a powerful tool for self-expression and connection.</p>   
    <p>In addition to music, I also enjoy practicing Hatha-Yoga. For me, yoga is a way to connect with my inner self and find balance in life. 
        <br>
        Through regular practice, I have learned to appreciate the beauty of stillness and the power of mindfulness.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about who I am.
